## Ceph vs MicroCeph: Key Differences

| Aspect | Full Ceph | MicroCeph |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Very High | Medium |
| **Setup Time** | Days to weeks | Hours |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep (months) | Moderate (days) |
| **Configuration** | 100+ options to tune | Sensible defaults |
| **Management Tool** | Multiple (ceph-deploy, cephadm, rook) | Single snap command |
| **Resource Usage** | Higher (8GB+ RAM/node) | Lower (4GB+ RAM/node) |
| **Customization** | Extensive | Limited but sufficient |
| **Monitoring** | Complex (Prometheus, Grafana setup) | Built-in |
| **Upgrades** | Manual, risky | Automated via snap |
| **Best Use Case** | 100TB+ storage, many teams | 1-50TB, small teams |
| **Documentation** | Extensive but overwhelming | Concise and focused |

**Bottom Line**: MicroCeph is Ceph with training wheels - you get the same underlying technology (it IS Ceph under the hood) but with automation that removes 90% of the operational complexity. Unless you're running a massive deployment or need deep customization, MicroCeph is the smarter choice.
