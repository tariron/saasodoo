# API Documentation
## Odoo SaaS Platform REST API

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Base URL:** `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1`

## üîê Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens obtained from Supabase. The platform uses JWT-based authentication with refresh token support for secure access to all resources.

### Authentication Flow
The authentication system follows OAuth 2.0 patterns with Supabase handling the underlying authentication infrastructure. Users authenticate using email/password credentials and receive access tokens for API requests.

## üìä API Endpoints

### üîê Authentication Endpoints

#### POST /auth/login
Authenticates users with email and password credentials. Returns access and refresh tokens along with user profile information. The access token is used for subsequent API requests, while the refresh token enables token renewal without re-authentication.

#### POST /auth/register
Creates new user accounts with email verification. Requires email, password, and full name. The system validates email uniqueness and password strength before account creation. New users receive verification emails for account activation.

#### POST /auth/refresh
Renews expired access tokens using valid refresh tokens. This endpoint maintains user sessions without requiring re-authentication. Refresh tokens have longer expiration periods and can be revoked for security purposes.
