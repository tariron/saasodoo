## Odoo SaaS Platform Issue Resolution

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Scope:** Development, Staging, Production

## 🎯 Overview

This guide provides comprehensive troubleshooting procedures for common issues encountered in the Odoo SaaS platform. Issues are categorized by component and severity level to enable quick resolution.

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Platform Down (Severity: Critical)

#### Symptoms
- Platform completely inaccessible
- All tenant instances down
- API returning 5xx errors

#### Immediate Actions
Check cluster node status and pod health across all namespaces. Verify critical services in the saasodoo-system namespace are running properly. Examine ingress controller status and logs for routing issues. Restart backend and frontend services if necessary to restore platform functionality.

#### Recovery Steps
1. **Identify root cause** using logs and metrics
2. **Restore from backup** if data corruption detected
3. **Scale up resources** if resource exhaustion
4. **Contact support** if issue persists

### Data Loss (Severity: Critical)

#### Immediate Actions
Stop all write operations by scaling down backend services to prevent further data corruption. Assess the extent of data damage using integrity checking tools. Restore from the most recent verified backup and validate the restoration process to ensure data consistency and completeness.

## 🔧 Component-Specific Issues

### Backend Service Issues

#### Issue: Backend Pods Crashing

**Symptoms:**
- Backend pods in CrashLoopBackOff state
- API endpoints returning 503 errors
- High restart count on backend pods

**Diagnosis:**
Check backend pod status and examine recent logs for error patterns. Review pod events for resource constraints or scheduling issues. Monitor resource usage to identify memory or CPU exhaustion. Analyze container restart patterns and exit codes for root cause identification.

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Memory/CPU Limits Exceeded**
   Increase resource limits for backend containers by updating deployment specifications. Adjust both CPU and memory limits based on observed usage patterns. Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling for dynamic resource management during peak loads.

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   Test database connectivity from backend pods using connection validation tools. Check PostgreSQL pod status and examine database logs for connection errors or resource constraints. Verify network policies allow communication between backend and database services.

3. **Configuration Issues**
   Verify environment variables and secrets are properly configured and accessible to backend pods. Check for missing or incorrect configuration values that could cause application startup failures. Validate external service credentials and connection strings.

#### Issue: Slow API Response Times

**Symptoms:**
- API requests taking >5 seconds
- Timeout errors in frontend
- High CPU usage on backend pods

**Diagnosis:**
Measure API response times using monitoring tools and check backend service metrics for performance bottlenecks. Analyze database query performance to identify slow operations. Review resource utilization patterns and connection pool status.

**Solutions:**

1. **Scale Backend Services**
   Implement horizontal scaling by increasing backend replica count and enable horizontal pod autoscaling for automatic capacity management during traffic spikes.

2. **Optimize Database Queries**
   Enable query logging to identify slow database operations and optimize problematic queries. Consider adding database indexes and implementing query result caching.

3. **Add Redis Caching**
   Verify Redis connectivity and implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. Configure cache expiration policies and monitor cache hit rates for optimization.

### Frontend Service Issues

#### Issue: Frontend Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Blank page or loading spinner
- 404 errors for static assets
- JavaScript console errors

**Diagnosis:**
Check frontend pod status and examine logs for application errors. Verify ingress configuration and routing rules. Test static asset accessibility and volume mount configurations.

**Solutions:**

1. **Restart Frontend Service**
   Perform rolling restart of frontend deployment and monitor rollout status to ensure successful completion.

2. **Check Static Asset Serving**
   Test static asset access through direct URL requests and verify volume mounts for asset storage are properly configured.

3. **Verify Backend Connectivity**
   Test API connectivity from frontend pods to backend services and ensure network policies allow proper communication.

### Database Issues

#### Issue: PostgreSQL Connection Failures

**Symptoms:**
- "Connection refused" errors
- Backend pods unable to connect to database
- Database pod in error state

**Diagnosis:**
Check PostgreSQL pod status and examine logs for startup errors or resource constraints. Verify persistent volume claims and storage availability. Test database connectivity from backend pods using connection validation tools.

**Solutions:**

1. **Restart PostgreSQL**
   Perform rolling restart of PostgreSQL StatefulSet and monitor for successful startup.

2. **Check Storage Issues**
   Verify disk space availability within database pods and check persistent volume claim status for any storage-related issues.

3. **Restore from Backup**
   List available backups and restore from the most recent valid backup if data corruption is detected.

#### Issue: Database Performance Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Slow query execution
- High CPU usage on database pod
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Diagnosis:**
Check active database connections and identify connection pool utilization. Analyze slow query logs to identify performance bottlenecks. Monitor database resource usage and storage performance.

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimize Database Configuration**
   Apply optimized PostgreSQL configuration settings and restart the database service to implement performance improvements.

2. **Add Connection Pooling**
   Deploy PgBouncer for connection pooling and update backend services to use the connection pooler for improved database connection management.

3. **Scale Database Resources**
   Increase CPU and memory limits for PostgreSQL containers based on observed usage patterns and performance requirements.

### Tenant Provisioning Issues

#### Issue: Tenant Creation Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Tenant stuck in "provisioning" state
- Kubernetes resource creation errors
- Timeout during tenant creation

**Diagnosis:**
Check tenant provisioning status using management tools and examine Kubernetes events for resource creation failures. Review provisioning service logs for error patterns and check cluster resource availability.

**Solutions:**

1. **Retry Provisioning**
   Retry tenant creation process using management tools with proper error handling and status monitoring.

2. **Check Resource Availability**
   Verify cluster node resources and storage availability to ensure sufficient capacity for new tenant provisioning.

3. **Manual Cleanup and Retry**
   Clean up failed provisioning resources and retry the tenant creation process with proper validation.

#### Issue: Tenant Isolation Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Tenants can access each other's data
- Network policies not enforced
- Resource limits not applied

**Diagnosis:**
Check network policy configuration and enforcement status. Verify resource quota application and namespace isolation settings. Test network connectivity between tenant namespaces.

**Solutions:**

1. **Reapply Network Policies**
   Reapply network policy configurations to ensure proper tenant isolation and traffic restrictions.

2. **Fix Resource Quotas**
   Apply resource quota configurations to tenant namespaces to enforce proper resource limits and isolation.

3. **Verify Namespace Isolation**
   Check namespace labels and pod security contexts to ensure proper tenant isolation is maintained.

### Networking Issues

#### Issue: DNS Resolution Problems

**Symptoms:**
