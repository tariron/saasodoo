## Infrastructure Design & Technical Architecture

 

### Overselling Strategy & Capacity Planning

 

#### Core Assumptions (Conservative Estimates)

- **RAM Utilization**: 50% of provisioned (idle containers, application overhead)

- **CPU Utilization**: 50% of provisioned (ERP systems are bursty, not sustained)

- **Storage Utilization**: 25% of provisioned (users take time to fill quota)

- **CephFS Replication**: 3x replication factor for HA

- **vCPU Overselling**: 10:1 on physical cores (industry standard for VPS)

 

#### Example: Business Plan Resource Math

**Provisioned to Customer:**

- 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 25 GB storage

 

**Actual Expected Usage (50/50/25% utilization):**

- 1 vCPU active, 2 GB RAM active, 6.25 GB storage used

 

**Raw Infrastructure Needed:**

- 1 vCPU (can oversell 10:1 on physical cores)

- 2 GB physical RAM (no overselling on RAM)

- 6.25 GB × 3 (Ceph replication) = **18.75 GB raw storage**

- **Capacity: 75 instances**

 

**Realistic Capacity: 27 active instances** (RAM-limited)

 

#### Customer Distribution Projection (500 Users)

 

Assuming 500 users across 50-60 businesses:

 

| Plan | Instances | Avg Users/Instance | Total Users | Monthly Revenue |

|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|

| Starter | 12 | 5 | 60 | $180 |

| Business | 25 | 10 | 250 | $725 |

| Professional | 18 | 8 | 144 | $1,062 |

| Enterprise | 5 | 9 | 46 | $595 |

| **Total** | **60** | **8.3 avg** | **500** | **$2,562** |

 

Wait, that's 60 instances but we only have capacity for 27. Let me recalculate with more aggressive overselling or higher user density per instance.

 

Actually, I need to reconsider. If we have 500 users and capacity for 27 instances:

- 500 users / 27 instances = 18.5 users per instance average

 

This is high but achievable for small businesses. Most instances will be Business or Professional plans with multiple users.

 

Let me recalculate:

 

| Plan | Instances | Avg Users/Instance | Total Users | Monthly Revenue |

|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|

| Starter | 3 | 8 | 24 | $45 |

| Business | 12 | 15 | 180 | $348 |

| Professional | 10 | 22 | 220 | $590 |

| Enterprise | 2 | 38 | 76 | $238 |

| **Total** | **27** | **18.5 avg** | **500** | **$1,221** |

 

#### Phase 2 Financial Metrics

 

| Metric | Value |

|--------|-------|

| Infrastructure COGS | $295.41/month |

| Projected MRR | $1,221/month |

| Gross Profit | $925.59/month |

| **Gross Margin** | **75.8%** |

| Cost per User | $0.59/month |

| Revenue per User | $2.44/month |

| Break-Even | 11 customers (≈$330 MRR) |

 

Hmm, the margin dropped and revenue per user is lower than Phase 1. This is because I'm assuming higher user density per instance (18.5 vs 4.5 users/instance).

 

The issue is that if businesses have more users, they should be on higher-tier plans. Let me reconsider the model.

 

Actually, the key insight is that **not all users translate to separate instances**. One business with 20 users only needs ONE instance (Professional or Enterprise plan).

 

So the correct way to think about it:

- Phase 1: 10-12 businesses (instances), 50 total users across those businesses

- Phase 2: 27 businesses (instances), 500 total users across those businesses

- Phase 3: Up to 150+ businesses (instances), 1000 total users

 

Let me recalculate Phase 2 correctly:

 

#### Phase 2 Customer Distribution (Corrected)

 

Assuming 27 businesses with 500 total users:

 

| Plan | # Businesses | Avg Users Each | Total Users | Revenue per Plan | Total Revenue |

|------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|

| Starter | 4 | 3 | 12 | $15 | $60 |

| Business | 10 | 8 | 80 | $29 | $290 |

| Professional | 10 | 25 | 250 | $59 | $590 |

| Enterprise | 3 | 52 | 156 | $119 | $357 |

| **Total** | **27** | **18.5 avg** | **498** | - | **$1,297** |

 

#### Phase 2 Financial Metrics (Corrected)

 

| Metric | Value |

|--------|-------|

| Infrastructure COGS | $295.41/month |

| Projected MRR | $1,297/month |

| Gross Profit | $1,001.59/month |

| **Gross Margin** | **77.2%** |

| Cost per User | $0.59/month |

| Revenue per User | $2.60/month |

| COGS per Instance | $10.94/month |

| Break-Even | 11 customers |

 

#### Migration Trigger

Migrate to Phase 3 when:

- 24 instances active (89% capacity) OR

- MRR reaches $1,200/month OR

- 5+ qualified leads on waitlist

 

---

 

### Phase 3: Scale (500-1,000+ Users)

 

#### Goal

Maximize customer density and profit margins with dedicated hardware, establish market leadership, prepare for Kubernetes migration.

#### Scaling Beyond 1,000 Users

 

When Phase 3 reaches 80% capacity (72 instances, ~800 users), options:

1. **Add 2 more Genoa nodes** ($378/month) → 200+ instance capacity

2. **Migrate to Kubernetes** with auto-scaling across cloud providers

3. **Upgrade to Turin 32-core** ($289/node) for 50% more capacity

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

 

### Technical Risks

 

#### Risk 1: Overselling Backfires - Performance Degradation

**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: High

 

**Scenario**: If 50% utilization assumption is wrong and customers use 70-80% of provisioned resources, performance suffers.

 

**Mitigation**:

- Implement resource monitoring with alerts at 60% utilization

- Burst capacity: provision 20% overhead buffer

- Auto-throttling: limit burst CPU to 150% of allocation

- Proactive upgrade path: offer free tier bumps before performance issues

 

#### Risk 2: Data Loss - Ceph Failure

**Likelihood**: Low | **Impact**: Critical

 

**Scenario**: Ceph cluster fails, 3x replication doesn't save data due to simultaneous node failures.

 

**Mitigation**:

- Off-site backups: Daily automated backups to Backblaze B2 ($5-10/TB/month)

- Multi-region: Phase 3 adds 4th node in different datacenter

- Testing: Quarterly disaster recovery drills

- SLA: 99.5% uptime guarantee with prorated refunds

 

#### Risk 3: Security Breach - Multi-Tenant Isolation Failure

**Likelihood**: Low | **Impact**: Critical

 

**Scenario**: Container escape or network misconfiguration allows tenant-to-tenant access.

 

**Mitigation**:

- Security audit: Quarterly penetration tests ($500-1,000/quarter)

- Network policies: Strict Kubernetes NetworkPolicies isolating tenants

- Secrets management: HashiCorp Vault for credentials

- Compliance: SOC 2 Type II by Month 18 ($15-25k investment)

- Insurance: Cyber liability insurance ($1,000-2,000/year)

 

### Business Risks

 

#### Risk 4: Customer Concentration

**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

 

**Scenario**: Top 5 customers represent >40% of MRR, one churns.

 

**Mitigation**:

- Diversification: No customer >15% of MRR

- Success programs: Quarterly check-ins for high-value customers

- Annual contracts: Incentivize annual prepay (10% discount, upfront cash)

 

#### Risk 5: Regulatory Changes - Data Residency

**Likelihood**: Low | **Impact**: Medium

 

**Scenario**: GDPR/CCPA equivalent requires specific data residency, Contabo doesn't offer required regions.

 

**Mitigation**:

- Multi-cloud: Phase 4 expansion to AWS/GCP for specific regions

- Data processing agreements: Have DPAs in place with Contabo

- Transparency: Clearly communicate data locations to customers

 

#### Risk 6: Competition from Odoo.com

**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

 

**Scenario**: Odoo drops pricing or launches competitive offering.

 

**Mitigation**:

- Differentiation: Focus on customer service and ease-of-use

- Lock-in (ethical): Make migrations easy, build loyalty through quality

- Speed: Move faster than enterprise competitors

- Niche: Target underserved segments (very small businesses)

 

### Market Risks

 

#### Risk 7: Economic Downturn - SMB Spending Cuts

**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

 

**Scenario**: Recession hits, small businesses cut software spending.

 

**Mitigation**:

- ROI messaging: Emphasize cost savings vs. alternatives

- Downgrade path: Easy plan downgrades, don't lose customers entirely

- Cash reserves: Maintain 6 months runway by Month 12

- Pivot: Can pivot to serving solopreneurs/freelancers (less recession-sensitive)

## Kubernetes Migration Plan (Phase 4 - Future)

 

### When to Migrate

 

Migrate to Kubernetes when:

1. Managing 150+ instances becomes operationally complex

2. Need multi-region deployment for performance/compliance

3. Want auto-scaling for cost optimization

4. Team grows to include dedicated DevOps resources

 

**Expected Timeline:** Month 24-30 (once fundamentals are proven)

 

### Migration Architecture

 

**Current State (Docker Swarm):**

- Simple orchestration, manual scaling

- Single-region deployment

- 3-node cluster

 

**Future State (Kubernetes):**

- Automated scaling, self-healing

- Multi-region (US-East, US-West, EU)

- 6-12 node cluster with node pools

 

### Infrastructure Provider Options

 

#### Option 1: Managed Kubernetes (Recommended for first K8s deployment)

- **Provider**: DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) or Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)

- **Cost**: ~$12/node/month (control plane) + node costs

- **Pros**: Managed control plane, easy setup, great docs

- **Cons**: More expensive than bare metal

 

#### Option 2: Self-Managed K8s on Contabo Dedicated

- **Provider**: Contabo dedicated servers + kubeadm/k3s

- **Cost**: Same server costs, $0 for control plane software

- **Pros**: Full control, lowest cost

- **Cons**: Requires K8s expertise, operational overhead

 

#### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended for Phase 4)

- **Control Plane**: Managed K8s (DOKS/LKE)

- **Worker Nodes**: Contabo dedicated servers as K8s nodes

- **Cost**: $36/month control plane + Contabo node costs

- **Pros**: Best of both worlds - managed control plane, cheap compute

- **Cons**: Complexity in networking, not officially supported

 

### Migration Strategy

 

**Step 1: Parallel Deployment (Months 24-26)**

- Deploy K8s cluster alongside existing Swarm

- Migrate non-critical services first (notification-service)

- Test extensively

 

**Step 2: Customer Migration (Months 26-28)**

- Migrate 10% of customers to K8s (starting with Starter tier)

- Monitor performance and costs

- Refine playbooks

 

**Step 3: Full Cutover (Months 28-30)**

- Migrate all customers over 6-8 weeks

- Scheduled maintenance windows

- Dual-run for 2 weeks before decommissioning Swarm

 

**Expected Migration Cost**: $2,000-5,000 in engineering time + $500-1,000 in temporary dual-infrastructure costs

## Appendix A: Infrastructure Upgrade Paths

 

### Phase 1 → Phase 2 Migration

 

**Trigger Point**: 10 active instances OR $300 MRR

 

**Migration Process:**

1. **Provision Phase 2 Infrastructure** (3x VDS nodes) - Day 1

2. **Setup Private Networking** - Day 1

3. **Deploy Ceph Cluster** - Day 2

4. **Migrate PostgreSQL** (streaming replication, then promote replica) - Day 3

5. **Migrate Redis/RabbitMQ** - Day 3

6. **Migrate Services** (user, billing, instance, notification) - Day 4

7. **Migrate Customers** (5 per day, rolling) - Days 5-7

8. **Decommission Phase 1 Infrastructure** - Day 10

 

**Downtime**: 5-10 minutes per customer during migration window

**Total Cost**: $295/month (Phase 2) + $33/month (Phase 1 overlap for 1 month) = $328

**Risk**: Low - rolling migration with fallback

 

### Phase 2 → Phase 3 Migration

 

**Trigger Point**: 24 active instances OR $1,200 MRR

 

**Migration Process:**

1. **Provision Phase 3 Infrastructure** (3x Genoa dedicated servers) - Day 1

2. **Setup Ceph Cluster** - Days 2-3

3. **Add Node 1 to existing cluster** (expand Ceph, migrate data in background) - Day 4

4. **Add Node 2 to existing cluster** - Day 5

5. **Add Node 3 to existing cluster** - Day 6

6. **Migrate services and databases** (streaming replication) - Day 7-8

7. **Migrate customer containers** (rolling, 10 per day) - Days 9-11

8. **Decommission Phase 2 infrastructure** - Day 14

 

**Downtime**: <2 minutes per customer (container restart)

**Total Cost**: $567/month (Phase 3) + $295/month (Phase 2 overlap for 1 month) = $862

**Risk**: Low - live cluster expansion, minimal disruption
