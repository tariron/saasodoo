### END OF FINANCIAL MODEL ###

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
1. Copy this entire file into Excel or Google Sheets
2. Use "Text to Columns" with comma delimiter to separate into proper columns
3. Each "### SHEET X ###" section can be a separate worksheet tab
4. Add formulas to link sheets together (e.g., revenue sheet feeds P&L)
5. Create charts: MRR growth, customer acquisition, cash flow waterfall
6. Customize assumptions (churn rate, CAC, pricing) based on your market research
7. Run scenarios: What if churn is 6%? What if you price Hustler at $10?

NEXT STEPS:
1. Validate pricing with 20+ customer interviews
2. Test CAC assumptions with $500 ad spend pilot
3. Build financial dashboard in Google Sheets with live data connection
4. Set up monthly financial review cadence (compare actuals vs. projections)
