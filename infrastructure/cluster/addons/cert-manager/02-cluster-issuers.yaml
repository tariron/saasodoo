# =============================================================================
# CURRENT SETUP: nip.io domains (*.62.171.153.219.nip.io)
# Use self-signed issuer - Let's Encrypt doesn't work well with nip.io
# =============================================================================

# Self-signed issuer (for nip.io domains / internal services / development)
# This is what you should use NOW with nip.io
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned
spec:
  selfSigned: {}

# =============================================================================
# FUTURE: When you have real domains (e.g., app.yourdomain.com)
# Uncomment and configure these issuers
# =============================================================================

# Let's Encrypt Staging Issuer (for testing - higher rate limits)
# Use this first to test your setup before switching to production

# Let's Encrypt Production Issuer (real certificates)
